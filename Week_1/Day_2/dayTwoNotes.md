### **Solving Problems with Pseudocode**

1. *Understand the Problem*
   * ask yourself, "what is the input to the problem?"

If we use Loopy Lighthouse as an example, we have several values as inputs:
 * the range 100 to 200
 * the strings "Loopy", "Lighthouse" and "LoopyLighthouse"
 * the multiples 3 and 4

   * then, ask youself "what is the expected output?"

Loopy Lighthouse output will look something like this:

```
   Lighthouse
   101
   Loopy
   103
   Lighthouse
   Loopy
   106
   107
   LoopyLighthouse
   ```





2. *Start Writing your Pseudocode*
